Hello everyone, this is Ko_Peng.  
Our team, N+ (NPLUS), is currently developing a new game.  
<img width="320" height="320" alt="NPLUS 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb4d38f-980c-4ebf-af2f-dcebf8007de5" />


The game is a **turn-based RPG for educational purposes**.  
At the start, the player selects a Markdown note file they’ve written.  
<img width="586" height="622" alt="Pasted image 20250914090645" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbddd007-068c-418f-a11a-7d4290891255" />

Based on its content, the AI automatically generates 10 quiz questions,  
and from there, the real game begins.

In each turn, the player must solve one question.  
If they answer correctly, they gain an advantage in battle,

but if they answer incorrectly, the monster attacks.

When answering correctly, the player can choose one of four actions:  
1. **Attack** – Deal damage to the enemy.

2. **Heal** – Recover 15 HP.

The game currently includes a variety of monsters,  
as well as level-up and game-over features.  

The main goal of this game is to **review your own notes in a fun way**.  
However, its applications go far beyond that.  
For example, checking your understanding after reading a book,  
practicing for exams, reviewing English vocabulary,  
or even serving as a brain-training tool to help prevent dementia.  

In other words, regardless of age or profession,  
anyone can enjoy this game for different purposes and situations.  

I plan to release it as a free web game  
so that many people can continue their studies more enjoyably and effectively.  

In addition, our team is currently recruiting  
game illustrators, game designers, and game programmers.  
If you’re interested, please send me a DM on Discord at **Korea_Penguin**.  

We’d greatly appreciate your interest and support. Thank you.
